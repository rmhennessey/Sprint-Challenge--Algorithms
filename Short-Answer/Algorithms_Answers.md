Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here. 

a) O(n^3) - count starts at 0 & stops at 1 less than n^3

b) O(n^4) - 4 loops that loop through

c) O(n) - runs n number of times until it hits 0

d)  - Take number of floors and divide in half (i.e.    start in middle)
    - Drop from highest floor of lower half. If breaks, go lower lower. 
    - If doesn't break, move to lowest floor of higher half. Go higher until you find highest floor it does not break from.
    - Binary Search = O(log n)
